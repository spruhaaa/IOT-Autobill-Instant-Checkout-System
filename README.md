⚙️ Installation

1. Install Arduino IDE
Download from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

2. Add ESP32 Board to Arduino IDE
- Go to **File > Preferences**
- In *Additional Boards Manager URLs*, add:

  - Open **Boards Manager**, search for **ESP32**, and install it.

3. Connect ESP32-CAM
- Use a USB to TTL converter
- Connect according to this pinout:
- `U0R` → TX of converter
- `U0T` → RX of converter
- `GND` → GND
- `5V` → VCC
- `IO0` → GND (for programming mode)

 4. Upload Code
- Choose board: **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**
- Select the correct COM port
- Upload the Arduino sketch provided in `/code`

🤖 Machine Learning Integration

The ML model (e.g., for object detection) is trained offline and converted to TensorFlow Lite or a custom binary format supported by ESP32. It is then deployed onto the ESP32-CAM via SPIFFS or SD card.

Workflow:
1. Train image classifier (e.g., MobileNet, custom CNN)
2. Optimize and quantize the model
3. Convert to TFLite or binary for ESP32
4. Load model on ESP32 and run inference using camera frames
